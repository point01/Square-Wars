# Chesseract
### A Multiplayer War Game Written In Unity
Chesseract inherits a great deal from tactical board games such as Fire Emblem, Advance Wars, and Final Fantasy Tactics. Our aim is to develop a multiplayer game that is both easy to learn and complex enough for competitive play. Early iterations will be for desktop only, with future versions including a mobile client.

This game is being developed as a capstone project.
