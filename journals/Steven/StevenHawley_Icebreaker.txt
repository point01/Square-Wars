Hi all,

I'm Steven Hawley. I'm also a CS senior and this is my last semester as well. My strengths are definitely my problem solving and logic skills. I am well versed in multiple languages, but my best is Java and C++. Java is what I have been using at work a lot. I am average at graphic design thanks to me taking the Computer Graphics class last Winter semester. My networking skills are average. I have had some experience in game design. Over the summer I played with Unity quite a bit and started making a game on Android. My have a very wide range of interests. I like video games, sports, cars, up-to-date tech, and I'm an outdoorsman. That being said, I am an avid gamer. I like my fps games, rpgs, jrpgs, strategy, sports, etc. As of late I have been more interested in RPGs. My most recent game that I have been playing is Dark Souls 2. 

I have always been extremely interested in completely making a full game and that's hard without a good team. I look forward to working with you all!
